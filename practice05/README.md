## FizzBuzz

Build a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

- Write a function that takes no parameters
- The function should output the numbers 1 through 100, following the rules from above

1. create a function with no parameters
2. it should loop through 100 times
3. check if there is a multiple of three, then print 'Fizz'
4. check if there is a multiple of five, then print 'Buzz'
5. check if the number is a multiple of three and five and then print 'FizzBuzz'
6. return function
